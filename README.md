**🚀 Introducing AD User Manager — Features & Use Cases! 🚀**

Managing Active Directory users can be complex and time-consuming. That’s why I built AD User Manager, a PowerShell-based GUI tool to make everyday AD user tasks easier and faster for IT teams.

Here’s a quick rundown of the key features and when to use them:

**🔍 Search & View User Details**
Scenario: Quickly check a user’s account status, group memberships, and GAL visibility before making changes or troubleshooting issues.

**🔄 Copy Group Memberships Between Users**
Scenario: When onboarding a new employee who needs the same access rights as an existing user, copy all groups easily without manual re-adding.

**❌ Remove All Groups**
Scenario: For offboarding or account cleanup, quickly remove a user’s group memberships to revoke access.

**🔑 Reset Password**
Scenario: Help users regain access by resetting their password and optionally forcing a password change at next login for security.

**✅❌ Enable/Disable Account**
Scenario: Temporarily disable accounts during leaves or disable compromised accounts to protect your environment.

**👻 Hide/Unhide from Global Address List (GAL)**
Scenario: Hide service or inactive accounts from the company address book to keep it clean and avoid confusion.

**🔄 Sync Entra Connect (Azure AD Sync)**
Scenario: After making AD changes, trigger a delta sync to push updates quickly to Azure AD for hybrid environments.

**🔄 Sync All Domain Controllers (DCs)**
Scenario: Ensure recent AD changes replicate across all DCs for consistency, especially after bulk updates.

**🛠️ Open Active Directory Users and Computers Console**
Scenario: Conveniently launch AD management console directly from the tool for more advanced user or group tasks.
This tool is designed to save time, reduce errors, and standardize AD user management workflows — making life easier for service desk teams and IT pros.

If you work with Active Directory daily, I’d love to hear your feedback or suggestions for new features!
